# Security Policy

## Overview

The Network Configuration Checker is designed with security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and the security features built into the application.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Features

### Credential Protection

- **AES-256 Encryption**: All device passwords are encrypted using AES-256 before storage
- **Key Management**: Application-specific encryption keys with proper key derivation
- **Memory Safety**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory immediately after use
- **No Plaintext Storage**: Credentials are never stored in plaintext anywhere in the system

### Network Security

- **SSH Protocol**: All device communications use secure SSH protocol
- **Host Key Verification**: SSH host key verification prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Connection Limits**: Configurable limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Timeout Management**: Proper timeout handling prevents hanging connections
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff prevents brute force attempts

### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized using Zod schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection attacks
- **XSS Protection**: All data displayed in the frontend is properly sanitized
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable timeouts
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-related operations

### Data Protection

- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally, no cloud transmission by default
- **Database Security**: SQLite database with proper access controls
- **File Permissions**: Restricted file permissions on configuration and data files
- **Secure Deletion**: Proper cleanup of temporary files and sensitive data

## Security Configuration

### Recommended Settings

#### Application Security

```json
{
  "security": {
    "sessionTimeout": 3600,
    "passwordProtection": true,
    "auditLogging": true,
    "maxLoginAttempts": 3,
    "lockoutDuration": 900
  }
}
```

#### Connection Security

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "sshTimeout": 30,
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "retryBackoff": "exponential",
    "hostKeyVerification": true,
    "maxConcurrentConnections": 10
  }
}
```

#### Data Retention

```json
{
  "dataRetention": {
    "checkResults": "90d",
    "auditLogs": "365d",
    "reports": "180d",
    "tempFiles": "24h"
  }
}
```

### Security Hardening

#### Production Deployment

1. **Enable Host Key Verification**: Always verify SSH host keys in production
2. **Use Strong Passwords**: Enforce strong password policies for device credentials
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep the application updated with latest security patches
4. **Network Segmentation**: Deploy on isolated network segments when possible
5. **Access Controls**: Implement proper user access controls and permissions

#### Environment Security

1. **Secure Installation**: Install in protected directories with appropriate permissions
2. **Firewall Configuration**: Configure firewalls to allow only necessary connections
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor application logs for suspicious activities
4. **Backup Security**: Encrypt backups and store them securely
5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of the deployment

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Network Configuration Checker, please report it responsibly:

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email us at: **security@yourorg.com**

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Environment**: Version information and environment details
5. **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include proof-of-concept code
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### Response Timeline

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly:

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours of report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Target resolution within 30 days for critical issues

### Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Initial report handled privately
2. **Vendor Notification**: We notify affected parties before public disclosure
3. **Coordinated Release**: Security fixes released before vulnerability details
4. **Public Disclosure**: Full details disclosed after fixes are available
5. **Credit**: Security researchers credited for responsible disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Device Credentials

- Use unique, strong passwords for each device
- Regularly rotate device credentials
- Use SSH keys instead of passwords when possible
- Never share credentials between devices

#### Application Usage

- Enable application password protection
- Use secure session timeouts
- Regularly review audit logs
- Keep the application updated

#### Network Security

- Deploy on secure, isolated networks
- Use VPNs for remote access
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies
- Implement proper firewall rules

### For Administrators

#### Deployment Security

- Follow security hardening guidelines
- Implement proper access controls
- Monitor system resources and logs
- Regular security assessments

#### Data Management

- Implement proper backup procedures
- Secure data retention policies
- Regular cleanup of old data
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest

#### Incident Response

- Develop incident response procedures
- Regular security training for staff
