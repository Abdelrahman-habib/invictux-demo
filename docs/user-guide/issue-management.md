# Issue Management Guide

This guide covers the comprehensive issue management system in the Network Configuration Checker, helping you track, prioritize, and resolve security issues efficiently.

## Issue Management Overview

The Issue Management system provides:

- **Centralized Issue Tracking**: All security issues in one place
- **Lifecycle Management**: Track issues from detection to resolution
- **Priority-based Workflow**: Focus on the most critical issues first
- **Collaboration Tools**: Assign, comment, and track progress
- **Automated Updates**: Issues update automatically based on check results
- **Reporting Integration**: Include issue data in compliance reports

## Understanding Security Issues

### Issue Creation

#### Automatic Issue Creation

**When Issues Are Created**

- Security checks fail (FAIL status)
- Warning conditions are detected (WARNING status)
- Error conditions prevent proper checking (ERROR status)
- Custom rules trigger violations

**Issue Properties**

- **Unique ID**: System-generated identifier
- **Title**: Descriptive issue name
- **Description**: Detailed issue explanation
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info
- **Status**: Open, Acknowledged, In Progress, Resolved, Closed
- **Device**: Associated network device
- **Check Rule**: Security rule that detected the issue
- **Evidence**: Supporting data and configuration details
- **Timestamps**: Created, updated, resolved dates

#### Manual Issue Creation

**Creating Custom Issues**

1. Navigate to Security â†’ Issues
2. Click "Create Issue"
3. Fill in issue details:
   - Title and description
   - Severity level
   - Associated device
   - Assignment information
4. Add supporting evidence
5. Save the issue

**Use Cases for Manual Issues**

- Issues discovered outside automated checks
- Compliance violations requiring tracking
